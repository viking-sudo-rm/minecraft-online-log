OnlineLog
====================
This is a plugin for the minecraft bukkit server mod.<br>
It will log which and how many players are online to a mysql database.<br>
You can use this data to create fancy charts on your web page (:

One row will be written to the database table each time the online players change.<br/>
For example when someone logs in or logs out.
